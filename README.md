# Email-Domain-switcher

Hey, this is my first repository i worked on while learning python....

Have you ever thought what if you change the domain name of your company?
How will you manage to switch all your employees email-addreses attached with the old domain extension.
No worries! I have written a script whcih helps you to switch your email extension with your new domain.
You only need to type your old_email, old_domain, new domail and you are done.
You will get your desire email with new domain extension.

I will be releasing the full verssion of this code soon. This verion is limited to one email. Means you can do your switch operation with one email at a time only.
But i will be uloading a full versin of this for sure in which you would be able to switch emails a much as you want.

Thankyou.
